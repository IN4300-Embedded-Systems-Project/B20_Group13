# RFID â€“ Based library Management System

### Group 13 - Cyber Punks

## Project Overview

The RFID-Based Library Management System is designed to streamline book check-in and check-out process in a library using RC522 RFID readers and a PC-based management system. This system automates the identification of books and library members, reducing effort and improving efficiency.
